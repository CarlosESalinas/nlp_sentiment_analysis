Sentiment Analysis: tweet classifier 

Sentiment analysis is part of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and aims to determine the underlying emotional tone of a string of words to classify them as positive,
negative or neutral. This is one way in which organizations can determine and categorize opinions about their products, services or brand. Sentiment analysis involves 
the use of data mining, machine learning (ML) models, deep learning (DL) and computational linguistics for text extraction and analysis.

The objective of this project is to implement ML models for the classification of tweets as racist or non-racist and to evaluate which ML model has the best performance.
